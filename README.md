# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This is a kaggle "getting started" data competition, that I have started working on. I got the dataset from kaggle website.
The data set consists of list of survived and non-survived passangers in the tragic Titanic accident. The goal is to apply machine 
learning tools to identify the passangers likely to survive/survived such a shipwreck.
